# Merchboy V2: User Experience Roadmap (The "Flux" Era)

## Core Philosophy: "The OS for Creativity"
V2 isn't just about adding features; it's about transforming the site from a "page you visit" into a "dashboard you live in". The UX will shift from **Static Navigation** to **Fluid Windows**.

## 1. The "Flux UI" Overhaul
*   **Window Manager:** Instead of full page reloads, apps (Beat Lab, Pocket Bro, Shop) open in floating, resizable windows on a "OS Desktop" background.
*   **Persistent Dock:** A MacOS-style dock at the bottom for quick switching between apps.
*   **Multitasking:** Feed your Pocket Bro in a small window while sequencing a beat in the main window.

## 2. The "Living" Background
*   **Day/Night Cycle:** The background gradient shifts based on real-world time.
*   **Squad Visualization:** If Team Neon is winning, the "OS" theme turns sharp and electric. If Zen is winning, it turns soft and fluid.

## 3. Social Presence (The "Party" Layer)
*   **Cursor Ghosts:** See generic cursors of other users currently on the site (like Figma).
*   **Live Tickers:** A news ticker at the top scrolling "User X just found a Rare Fish!" or "Team Neon took the lead!".

## 4. Onboarding & Progression (The RPG Layer)
*   **Tutorial Quest:** A new user is greeted by "Tutorial Bro" who guides them to their first badge.
*   **XP Notification:** A unified "Toast" system (Top Right) for every XP gain, nicely aniamted.
*   **Level Up Animations:** Full screen takeover celebration when reaching Level 10, 20, etc.

## 5. Mobile "Super-App" Feel
*   **Gesture Controls:** Swipe left/right to change apps like TikTok/Instagram.
*   **Haptic Language:** Standardize haptics so "Error", "Success", and "Notification" have distinct vibration patterns users learn to recognize without looking.

## 6. Accessibility & Localization
*   **High Contrast Mode.**
*   **Gamepad Support:** Navigate the entire OS using an Xbox/PS controller.
