# Merchboy V2: "Street Ready" UX Roadmap

## Philosophy
Move from a "Website" layout to a "Vertical Feed & Utility Belt" layout. Prioritize "Hype" (Loot/Drops) and "Habit" (Daily Feed).

## 1. The Vertical Feed (Home)
Transform `Home.jsx` into a scrolling feed of interactive cards, mimicking a social media timeline but for utility and play.

*   **Slot 1: The Pocket Status:** Validates your pet is alive. One-tap "Feed" button directly on the card.
*   **Slot 2: The War Room:** Live Squad vs Squad bar. 
*   **Slot 3: Daily Drop:** A loot box that shakes until opened.
*   **Slot 4: Game of the Day:** Rotates daily (e.g., "Tuesday is Fishing Day - 2x Coins").

## 2. "The Utility Belt" (Navigation)
Shift from Header Links to a bottom **Sticky Dock**.
*   **[HOME]** - The Feed.
*   **[ARCADE]** - The Grid of games.
*   **[+] CREATE** - Central Action Button (opens BeatLab or Coloring).
*   **[SHOP]** - The Merch store.
*   **[ID]** - Your Profile/Passport.

## 3. The "Hype" Engine (Loot UX)
Unified reward screen for all activities.
*   **Visual:** Full-screen overlay, dark backdrop, spotlight on the item.
*   **Action:** "Tap to Reveal" interaction (scratch-off or tap-to-open).
*   **Share:** "Flex" button to copy a link/image of your drop to Clipboard.

## 4. Pocket Bro "Companion Mode"
The Pet breaks out of its page.
*   **Corner Overlay:** A small floating bubble (Chat Head style) on other pages.
*   **Reactive:**
    *   *Shopping:* "Buy the red one!"
    *   *Gaming:* "I'm dizzy!" (if you lose).
    *   *Hustle:* "Work harder!"

## 5. "App-Like" Motion
*   **Page Transitions:** Horizontal slide (IOS style) instead of instant snaps.
*   **Gestures:** Pull-to-refresh on the Home Feed to update Squad Scores.
*   **Double Tap:** Double tap anywhere on blank space to "Like" (gives 1 coin, max 10/day).

## 6. The "Dark Mode" Default
*   Shift default aesthetic to "Midnight Street" (Dark Gray/Black backgrounds, Neon accents).
*   Light mode reserved for "Daytime" events or specific "Retro" games.
