# Merchboy Digital Playground: V2 Roadmap (The Interconnected Era)

## 1. Social Core (Multiplayer)
*   **Live Leaderboards:** Replace `localStorage` high scores with a real Firebase/Supabase backend to enable global competition.
*   **Bro-ID Profiles:** Public profile pages showing your `PocketBro`, your `BeatLab` tracks, and your `Arcade` Trophies.
*   **Friend System:** Add friends, see when they are online, and challenge their scores directly.
*   **Squad Chat:** A "Neon" chat room and a "Zen" chat room for faction coordination.

## 2. Economic Expansion
*   **The Marketplace:** Allow users to sell/trade items they find in `CrazyFishing`.
*   **Crafting System:** Combine `ColoringCanvas` stickers and `Fishing` loot to create unique Profile Skins.
*   **Raffles:** Spend Arcade Coins to enter weekly real-life merch giveaways.

## 3. Creative Studio Upgrade
*   **Beat Lab Pro:** Save tracks to cloud, share links, remix other users' beats.
*   **Sticker Maker:** Draw your own stickers in a pixel-art editor and use them in the Canvas.
*   **Room Designer:** A "Habbo Hotel" style isometric room builder where your Pocket Bro lives.

## 4. New Games
*   **Rogue-lite Dungeon Crawler:** A deeper game where you use your `Shop` weapons to fight through floors of glitches.
*   **Multiplayer Racer:** "Face Runner" but against 3 other real players in real-time.

## 5. Mobile App
*   Wrap the PWA into a native container (Capacitor/React Native) for Push Notifications (Crucial for Pocket Bro survival).
*   Home Screen Widgets for Squad War status.

## 6. The "Hardware" Link
*   **QR Codes on Physical Merch:** Scanning a tag on a real Merchboy Hoodie unlocks that hoodie for your Pocket Bro in-game.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Point camera at a sticker to see 3D animations.
