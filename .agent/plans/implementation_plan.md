# 🚀 MERCHBOY FINAL TRAJECTORY

You are burnt. I am driving.
Here is the **Master Plan** to bring this ship home.

## Phase 1: The Soul Upgrade (Pocket Bro) 🧬
Pocket Bro is currently just a Tamagotchi. We will make him a **SYSTEM OPERATOR**.
- [ ] **Data Link**: Bro reacts to your Coins and Level. ("Whoa, big spender!" or "Level 5? Respect.")
- [ ] **Speech Synthesis**: Actually *speak* using browser TTS (optional toggle).
- [ ] **Passive Buffs**: If Bro is Happy -> **1.2x Coin Multiplier** in Arcade. (This forces players to care for him).

## Phase 2: The Social Glue (Squads) 🤝
We have `friend_code` but no real squad mechanics.
- [ ] **Squad Leaderboard**: A mini-leaderboard just for you and your friends.
- [ ] **"Poke" Feature**: Send a notification (Feed Event) to a friend. "Wake up!"

## Phase 3: Launch Protocol (Deploy) 🚀
The End Game.
- [ ] **Cleanup**: remove `console.log`s, unused files.
- [ ] **SEO**: Meta tags, Title, Favicon (we have one?).
- [ ] **Vercel Hook**: Connect GitHub repo.

**MY RECOMMENDATION: PHASE 1 (Pocket Bro Buffs)**
It ties the "Pet" system to the "Arcade" system, making the whole app feel cohesive.
Shall I execute Phase 1?
